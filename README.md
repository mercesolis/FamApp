# FamApp -- Capstone

## Rubric

- [x] App is hosted (obvi)
- [x] Use bootstrap with all custom components (Add Event Modal)
- [x] Use Angular Material ('Event Added' matsnackbar)
- [?] Instructor's discretion. (Design, usefulness, look and feel, clean code, etc) (FullCalendar looks good, just doesn't fully work yet)
- [ ] Utilizes another API (I got an API key from a federal holiday api but couldn't implement it into fullcalendar :() 

## FullCalendar

the calendar *techincally* works, just doesn't add events to the database, however some cool features I **did** get working:

- drag and drop an event!
- drag ends of event to lengthen or shorten dates
- added an "add event" button (does not currently work lol)
- change calendar views: month, week, day, list


## My Events link (where the magic happens)
